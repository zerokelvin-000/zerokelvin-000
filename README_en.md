A computer enthusiast, but certainly not libraries ;)<br>
I prefer to create a program manually rather than relying on already developed libraries, why? Honestly I don’t know either, but I’m sure that this practice applies also to programming languages,
in fact no NodeJS, React or other popular languages.
In addition to websites I also enjoy creating PCBs, but they don’t do much for me.
